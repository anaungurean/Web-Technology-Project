               <h2>1. Abstract </h2>
               <p>  In this Scholarly HTML document, we focus on specifying the
                 main requirements related to the essential functionalities of an application and its user interaction.

        <section id="Introduction">
                 <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
                 <h3 id="project-subjec">2.1 Project Description</h3>
                 <p> Hema is a web-based manager designed to aid in organizing collections of graphic representations of 
                    pressed plants along with their related attributes.
                    This platform is suitable for botanists, herbalists, or nature enthusiasts who enjoy collecting and 
                    preserving plant specimens. Hema provides a convenient and user-friendly interface 
                    to manage your herbal collection. With Hema, it is easy to upload images of your pressed plants, 
                    add relevant information such as their scientific and common names, descriptions, locations,
                    and dates of collection, and keep track of their attributes, properties, and uses.
                 </p>

                 <h3 id="motivatio">2.2 Motivation</h3>
                 <p>
                    We chose this project for the subject Technological Web due to the fact that we are motivated to 
                    raise awareness about the importance of preserving plant life and creating a digital collection that can be accessed by people all over the world.
                    An online herbarium website can help promote public awareness and appreciation for plants and their role in the environment. 
                    By providing a visually engaging and informative platform, the website can help educate the general public about the importance of plant biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability.
                 </p>

                 <h3 id="user">2.3 Potential Users </h3>
                 <p>
                    Our online herbarium can be a valuable resource for a diverse range of users, from botany and biology students to researchers, professionals, environmentalists, conservationists, gardeners, landscapers, and the general public.
                    The online herbarium can also be a valuable resource for anyone, who can use it to learn about different plant species, their characteristics, and their importance for the environment.

        <section id="user-experience">
            <h2> 3. User-Experience</h2>
                <p>
                We make an effort to create great experience for our users by choosing appropriate fonts and colors. We consider that  a positive UX can contribute to a website's credibility and reputation,
                as users are more likely to trust and recommend a site that provides a seamless and enjoyable experience. </p>

            <h3 id="colors" > 3.1 Colors </h3>
            <p>
                The chosen color palette for a website that is a herbarium  can have a significant impact on the user experience and the overall feel of the website.
                 The palette of colors chosen (606C38, 283618, FEFae0, DDA15E, BC6C25) 
                 incorporates various shades of green and brown, which are commonly associated with nature and plant life. 
                 This can help to create an inviting and organic feel to the website, which is appropriate for a herbarium.
                The use of light and muted colors (such as FEFae0) also helps to create a calming and soothing atmosphere, 
                 which can encourage users to spend more time exploring the site. Additionally, 
                  the contrast between the green and brown shades (606C38, 283618, DDA15E, BC6C25) can help 
                  to highlight important elements and create a visually appealing and cohesive design.
                   Overall, the chosen color palette is well-suited for a website that is a herbarium
                and can help to create a memorable and enjoyable user experience.
            </p>
          
            <h3 id="fonts" > 3.1. Fonts </h3>
            <p>
                The font choice for a website's pages can play a significant role in shaping the overall user experience and creating the desired aesthetic. 
                Regular Brush, that is used for the welcome page, is a handwritten font that features bold and flowing strokes, creating a unique and eye-catching appearance. 
                This font is often used for creative and informal designs, which can be suitable for a welcoming and friendly atmosphere on a website.
                Regular Brush's irregular and slightly imperfect style can add a human touch to the design, which can help to create a more personal connection with the users.
                Additionally, the font is highly legible, which is important for ensuring that the content on the welcome page is easily
                readable and accessible to all users. Also, "Simple Handmade", which is used for info text,
                is a font that has a handwritten and natural look, which can make it an appropriate choice for a website related to nature, such as a herbarium. 
                Serif fonts are used for headers because they can convey a sense of sophistication, elegance, and professionalism. The serif font has small lines or flourishes at the ends of each letter, which can make them easier to read and distinguish from other letters in the text.

        <section id="front-end">
            <h2> 4. Front-End Pages</h2>
            <p>
                HTML and CSS were used to create the pages,
                and the subsequent lines provide a description of the functions of each individual page.
            </p>
             
            <h3 id="welcome"> 4.1 Welcome Page </h3>
            <p>
                The Welcome page serves as an introduction to the website. The two buttons for Log in and Sign up are crucial for enabling users to access the full range of features available on the website, such as saving and managing their own herbarium collection. 
                The header with Home, About, Help and Contact references provides 
                easy navigation for users to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3 id="about"> 4.2 About Page </h3>
            <p>
                The About page is an important component of any website, as it provides visitors with valuable information about the website's purpose, goals, and values. For our herbarium website that includes  a description of what the website is, the page can serve to give users a better understanding of the purpose and context of the website.
                This can help to establish credibility and trust with users, as they are more likely to engage with a website that is transparent and informative about its goals and intentions. 
            </p>

            <h3 id="help"> 4.3 Help Page </h3>
            <p>
                The Help Page provides users with a resource to answer frequently asked questions about the site's functionalities. 
                This can improve the user experience by helping users quickly and easily find the information they need to 
                navigate the website and use its features effectively. The help page can also reduce the number of support 
                requests or inquiries directed to the website's customer support team,  which can save time and resources. By providing clear 
                and concise answers to common questions,  a help page can also enhance the website's credibility and reputation as a reliable 
                and helpful resource for plant enthusiasts.
            </p>

            <h3 id="contact"> 4.4 Contact Page </h3>

                The Contact Page allows users to connect with the website administrator or team, report issues, provide feedback, and make requests. This can help to improve the user experience and engagement on the website.
            </p>

            <h3 id="login"> 4.5 Log In Page </h3>
            <p>
                The Login Page allows users to access personalized content and features. By requiring a username and password, the website can ensure that the user's information is secure and protected. The "forgot password" button can be useful in case the user forgets their login credentials and needs to reset their password.
                 Additionally, providing an option to create a new account can be beneficial for users who are new to the website or have not yet registered.
            </p>

            <h3 id="singup"> 4.6 Sing Up Page </h3>
            <p>
                The Sing Up Page enables users to create a personalized account, which can enhance their experience on the site and allow them to save their preferences and settings. This can make it easier and faster for them to access the information they need.
            </p>

            <h3 id="home"> 4.7 Home Page </h3>
            <p>
                The Home Page that is accessible only after logging allowing the user to choose their intended action 
                (such as finding a plant, adding a new plant, viewing their plant collection, viewing their profile, see some statistics and having the option to download them in different formats, searching for images of plants from Unsplash by some keywords ) 
                in this way, it can save the user time and effort by directing them to the appropriate section of the website.
                This can also help to reduce confusion and frustration for the user, as they are not presented with an overwhelming amount of information or options.
            </p>

            <h3 id="find"> 4.8 Find Plants Page</h3>
            <p>
                The Find Plants Page can be highly useful for users who are searching for a particular plant with specific characteristics or features using multi-criterial search. 
                This can be especially beneficial for individuals who are interested in identifying or learning more about different plant species, such as botanists, herbalists, or nature enthusiasts. 
                By allowing users to input their specifications (e.g., plant type, color, date of collection, location, species, family, genus  etc.) into a filter system, 
                the website can quickly and efficiently provide a list of relevant plants that match the user's criteria. 
                This can save users time and effort in their search for a specific plant, and can also help to enhance their overall experience on the website.  
                Also, after the user is logged in, in navbar would appear the option to search for a plant by some keywords (e.g. "begonia plant", "red tulip"). The user can search in this way no matter from what page he/she is in that moment.
                Another aspect is that, when the user clicks on the photo of a plant, he/she can see the plant's profile page that contains information about that plant and also the username of the collector of the plant.
                Another functionality is that, if the user clicks on the username of the collector, he/she will be taken to the user's profile to see information about him/her and can also view his/her garden.
            </p>

            <h3 id="add"> 4.9 Add A New Plant Page</h3>
            <p>
                The Add A New plant Page allows users to contribute to the collection and expand the knowledge base of the site.
                By allowing users to add new plants with specifications and photos, the website can become a collaborative platform for plant enthusiasts and experts to share their knowledge and discoveries. 
                This can increase engagement and interaction with the website, as users are more likely to return to the site to check on their contributions and discover new plant specimens. 
                Additionally, the ability to upload photos and detailed information about the plants can enhance the educational value of the website and provide a valuable resource for research, education, and conservation efforts.
             </p>

             <h3 id="garden"> 4.10 View My Garden</h3>
             <p>
                Having a page where the user can view all the plants they have added to their collection is important because it allows them to easily keep track of their plants and monitor their growth and development. 
                Additionally, having a feature where users can click on a photo of a plant and view its profile can provide them with useful information about the plant's characteristics, properties, and uses. 
                This can help users to learn more about the plants in their collection.

            <h2>5. Back-End </h2>
            <h3 id="description">5.1 Description</h3>
            <p> 
            The Hema application was created utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript languages. The backend of the application is
            handled by PHP and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
            
            For authentication purposes, a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) system was implemented to ensure security and user authentication.
            This mechanism allows users to authenticate by providing a valid JWT token, which is generated and stored during their
            authentication process.

            <br>

            The frontend and backend are closely related when it comes to communication. The browser sends HTTP requests, receives
            responses back, and uses the information to render the pages for the user to view.
            
            The backend typically responds to the browser with information related to HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON files.
            </p>
        
            <h3 id="architecture">5.2 Architecture </h3>
            <p>
                By employing the MVC architecture, the application logic is divided into three main components: the Model, View, and
                Controller. The Model is responsible for interacting with the database and processing data, while the View handles the
                presentation of information through the graphical interface. The Controller manages the control logic of the application
                and serves as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
                
                This structure facilitates code organization and modularity, making it easier to develop, maintain, and extend the
                application.
            </p>

            <h3 id="security">5.3 Security </h3>
            <p>
                User data is stored in the database, with the password being encrypted, and at the session level, the data is not
                accessible to the user.
                <br>
                All database queries are protected against SQL Injection attacks.
            </p>

            <h3 id="data-architecture">5.4 Data Architecture </h3>
            <p>
                The information extracted from the database using the PHP script is transformed into JSON text format. This data is then
                fetched using JavaScript, where it is decoded and parsed. The required information is then processed on the web page to
                generate information about plants and users.
